Welcome to GID113, Interactive Web Design!

I've created this repo as a handy reference tool for my web design students.

## DEMO CODE

### Week 5: More Bootstrap
In this demo, I show how Bootstrap can be used to:

- Build a Single-Page Website
- Build a Simple Navigation Bar
- Construct a Simple Grid Layout

#### index.html
This file demonstrates a single-page website when all content is coded on the same page.

#### index2.html
This file demonstrates a single-page website when content is broken out into multiple files:
- about.html
- contact.html
- navbar.html
- services.html
